# clipbordConvertBetweenWindowsAndWslFilePath
Takes whatever is in your clipboard, tries to figure out whether its a Linux or Windows style path, then tries to figure out if the path leads somewhere within the WSL environment or not and finally converts from the current path style (Windows path to Linux style and vise versa) to the other.
